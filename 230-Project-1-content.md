# As Fun As Watching Paint Dry
## High Concept
Have you ever wanted to play splatoon but with no competition where the only goal was to paint stuff? Well do I have news for you! This game combines all of the bright colors of Nintendo's classic with a more relaxed and creative environment.

## Genre
Casual Sandbox-type game

## Platform
Initially this game will be desktop only, however I hope to expand it to other electronic devices in the future.

## Story
After getting caught doing graffiti on the walls of your school, you have been forced to attend creativity workshops in order to 'encourage contructive and legal expressions of creativity' . . . whatever that means. Oh well, spending an afternoon spray painting giant canvases instead of brick walls isn't too bad. It's actually sort of relaxing.

## Aesthetics
The graphics are fun, bright, and bubbly to encourage a creative environment for the user. The sounds are simple, yet upbeat. There will be background music while playing, along with sound for the paint, the avatar movement, and menu interactions. The idea is to provide the user with a relaxing interactive experience.

## Gameplay
Allow your avatar to paint pictures using a paint gun and the lines on the floor.

### Mechanics
Negative Space is used to encourage the user to fill it!
Paint - by clicking and dragging the mouse around the avatar, the screen is filled with the color of their choice
Line Mode - Giving the avatar line art on the ground which they can fill in
Sandbox Mode - Giving the avatar a large blank canvas and allowing for them to manipulate the space however they would like

### Control
Control is through keyboard and mouse - keyboard for movement, mouse for aim.

### Onboarding
There isn't really a wrong way to play the game. There are very minimal amount of instructions given if the user just presses play, however there is an instructions button that they can click on if they are confused. Overall, the controls are mouse and keyboard and should be intuitive for people equipped with basic computer skills

### Player Learning
There isn't any end goal in this game so there's no 'secret strategy' to learn in order to win. The only thing needed to succeed is to have fun.
